# MPM_Fluids
2D Fluid simulation using the material point method

Features:
 - MPM fluids using PIC, FLIP, APIC, PolyPIC transfers based on (citation needed)
 - Standard pressure Poisson equation approach to PIC fluids.
 -  Implicit Density Projection for fluids (citation needed).

ToDo:
 - Everything listed in the code files
 - - Neatening up rendering code, command line arguments, more arguments from input file etc.
